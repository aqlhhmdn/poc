            <h3 class="text">A place where feelings are validated. <br><br>Humans are known to have emotions, a variety of emotions like happiness, sadness, fear, anger and disgust. 
            We must recognise our emotion and confront it. Constantly invalidating our own feelings or emotions will only make it worse. Acknowledge them, feel them, and set them free.
            <br><br>I hope you find the comfort you need.  </h3>
